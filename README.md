# ShareSpot

This is the prototypical implementation for the master thesis *Ad-Hoc Data Sharing between Mobile Devices in an AR Environment*.

To run this application you need to have [Unity](https://unity3d.com/de) and an existing laser tracking system called [Pharus](https://www.aec.at/futurelab/en/team/otto-naderer/) installed. This implementation is using the room setup which can be found in the PIE-Lab at the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria in Hagenberg.

## Installation

This project consists of two parts, first a client application which can be run on any mobile device and second the ShareSpot server which should be run on desktop device. Both parts are using different scenes and can be created within in Unity over the menu.
